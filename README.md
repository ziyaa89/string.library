String-Library Project

Project Information

Created by: Ziya Moore (V00709162)
Course: Programming 05
Description

This project is a custom string library developed as part of my Programming 05 class. The goal was to build basic string manipulation functions 
without using any built-in Python string methods or libraries. 
This hands-on approach allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of string processing by implementing fundamental operations from scratch.

Project Contents

The library consists of several functions to handle string operations using predefined constants:

ASCII_LOWERCASE: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
ASCII_UPPERCASE: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
DECIMAL_DIGITS: "0123456789"
Functions Included
is_alpha(word): Checks if a string consists only of alphabetic characters.
is_digit(s): Checks if a string consists only of numeric characters.
to_lower(s): Converts uppercase characters to lowercase.
to_upper(s): Converts lowercase characters to uppercase.
find_chr(s, char): Finds the first occurrence of a specified character.
find_str(s, substr): Finds the first occurrence of a specified substring.
replace_chr(s, old, new): Replaces all instances of a specified character with a new character.
replace_str(s, old, new): Replaces all occurrences of a specified substring with a new substring.
Example Output
Hereâ€™s a sample output showing the results of the library functions:

Success and Learning Outcomes
The project was successful in meeting the assignment requirements. I was able to implement each function without relying on any built-in string methods. The process of building these functions enhanced my understanding of string manipulation, indexing, and looping techniques.

What I Learned
String Processing Fundamentals: I learned how to manipulate strings by accessing each character individually, which deepened my knowledge of string indexing.
Problem-Solving Skills: Creating custom implementations for functions like find_str and replace_str helped me improve my logical thinking and debugging skills.
Coding Efficiency: Through this project, I also learned the importance of efficient code, particularly with string processing, as performance can quickly degrade with poorly optimized loops in larger strings.
